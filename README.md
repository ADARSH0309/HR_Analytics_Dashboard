# HR Analytics Dashboard

## Project Description
The HR Analytics Dashboard is a Power BI project designed to analyze and visualize employee attrition data within an organization. The dashboard helps HR professionals and management teams understand the patterns and trends behind employee attrition. This data-driven approach enables organizations to identify factors contributing to attrition and develop targeted strategies for improving employee retention.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to provide a comprehensive view of employee attrition across different demographics, job roles, and compensation levels, enabling HR departments to make informed decisions for better talent management and employee engagement.

## Dashboard Features and Metrics

The dashboard covers various HR metrics, divided into different sections to help analyze attrition effectively.

### Summary Metrics
- **Count of Employees**: 1,470
- **Total Attrition**: 237 employees
- **Attrition Rate**: 16.1%
- **Average Age**: 37 years
- **Average Salary**: 6.5K
- **Average Tenure**: 7 years

These metrics provide an overview of the organization's workforce and the general attrition trend, helping HR quickly assess the scale of attrition.

### Attrition by Demographics and Education
- **Attrition by Education**: This pie chart shows the distribution of attrition based on employees' educational backgrounds. Key segments include:
  - Life Sciences (38%)
  - Medical (27%)
  - Marketing (15%)
  - Technical Degree (14%)
  - Other (5%)
  
  This breakdown highlights which educational backgrounds have the highest attrition, suggesting areas for targeted retention efforts.

- **Attrition by Age Group**: The bar chart divides attrition across different age groups:
  - 26-35 (highest attrition with 116 employees)
  - 18-25 (44 employees)
  - 36-45 (43 employees)
  - 46-55 (26 employees)
  - 55+ (8 employees)

  This information allows HR to identify which age groups are most at risk of leaving, informing strategies tailored to specific career stages.

- **Attrition by Salary Slab**: The bar chart displays attrition based on different salary brackets:
  - Up to 5K (163 employees, highest)
  - 5K-10K (49 employees)
  - 10K-15K (20 employees)
  - 15K+ (5 employees)
  
  This visualization indicates that lower-salary employees are more likely to leave, potentially highlighting dissatisfaction with compensation among this group.

- **Attrition by Tenure (Years at Company)**: This line chart represents attrition based on the number of years employees have been with the company. The chart peaks at 1 year with 16 employees leaving, and gradually decreases, with low attrition among long-tenured employees. These insights suggest that employees are most at risk of leaving early in their tenure, indicating a need for improved onboarding or early engagement programs.

- **Attrition by Job Role**: The horizontal bar chart shows attrition by different job roles. Key roles with high attrition include:
  - Laboratory Technician (62 employees)
  - Sales Executive (57 employees)
  - Research Scientist (47 employees)
  - Sales Representative (44 employees)
  - Human Resources (12 employees)
  
  By understanding which job roles have high attrition, HR can focus on roles with specific retention challenges, such as Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives.

- **Gender-Based Attrition**: This section shows attrition by gender:
  - Males: 140
  - Females: 79
  
  Gender-based analysis allows HR to check if any gender-specific interventions are needed for improving retention.

- **Interactive Filters**: The top of the dashboard includes filters for different departments (e.g., Human Resources, Sales, Research), allowing users to analyze attrition data within specific departments. This feature helps pinpoint department-specific attrition trends.

## Insights and Recommendations

### Key Insights
- **High Attrition in Early Tenure**: Employees with around 1 year of experience have the highest attrition. Improving early-career engagement, onboarding, and mentorship could help retain these employees.
- **Salary Influence**: Employees with lower salaries (up to 5K) are more likely to leave, suggesting a need to review compensation strategies.
- **Attrition by Job Role**: Job roles such as Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives show higher attrition, indicating a need to address role-specific challenges or job satisfaction.
- **Age Group Targeting**: The 26-35 age group shows the highest attrition, which may indicate mid-career dissatisfaction or career transition trends.

### Recommendations
- **Targeted Retention Programs**: Develop retention initiatives specifically for high-risk groups such as employees in early tenure, younger age groups, and lower salary brackets.
- **Compensation Review**: Consider reviewing salary structures for roles and groups with high attrition to enhance retention.
- **Job Role Assessment**: Investigate job satisfaction and workload for high-attrition roles like Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives.

## Conclusion

This HR Analytics Dashboard provides a data-centric approach to understanding employee attrition, empowering HR teams to identify problem areas and implement effective retention strategies. By leveraging insights from this dashboard, organizations can make informed decisions that lead to a more stable and engaged workforce.
